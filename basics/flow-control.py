# Comparison Operators, only with int and float
# >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=
# They also return boolean value
print(4 < 5)
print(5 > 2)


# >= is called greater than or equal to
a = 9
b = 9
print(a >= b) # If left value is greater or equal to right value then it returns true

# <= is called less than equal to
print(a <= b)


# Not operator

# not operator inverts boolean values
print(not True)

print(not False)

# not can be denoted by !
#print(True)
#print(False)
